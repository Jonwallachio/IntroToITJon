<H3>My personal IT profile</H3>
<p> My name is Jonathon Wallace. My student number is s3921371. My email address is s3921371@student.rmit.edu.au </p>

<p> I live in the Inner West of Sydney. I have worked in IT for a number of years as a product owner, business analyst and scrum master. 
I now work in telecommunications. I am married with one son, a six year old boy. </p>
<p> I have a bachelor's degree but I am returning to university study after many years and trying to balance that with full time work. 
I am a joint US/Australian citizen and I enjoy a number of different hobbies, including going to the gym, watching lots of different sports, reading and playing the occaisonal video game.</p>

<p>I have been employed in IT for approximately 7 years. I have worked as a product owner, then a business analyst and finally as a scrum master. My roles have not involved software development directly, and I have undertaken this course to help enable me to learn how to become a software developer.</p>
<p>I became interested in IT from my workplace experiences. I began working various projects that involved IT and became more and more fascinated. I made it a career goal to become involved. I have scrum mastered for large teams of developers and been involved in virtually every step of thw process of software development, except for the actual software development itself. My commencing this degree is an attempt to close that gap.  </p>
<p>RMIT seemed like a good option as they have recieved a lot of good feedback about their online courses. I have no choice other than to complete the degree online, as I work full time and have a family and other obligations. Open Universities was my stepping stone into the degree here at RMIT.</p>
<p>I hope to slowly build up my ability to more directly involve my self in the software development cycle. I expect to remain as a Scrum Master, though who knows where the future will take me. Maybe at the end of my degree I'll move into software development itself.</p>
